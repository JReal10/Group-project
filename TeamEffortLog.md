# Team Effort Log
*In this section, add a heading for each team member, and under it add the sub headings "Sprint 1, Sprint 2, ..., Sprint N", as illustrated below.  Each team member can be responsible for writing their own section.*

## Mich Hamer

*Edit the name above to match the name of the team member.  That team member is then responsible for this section.*

### Sprint 1 (University Week 3):
* *Include a URL to the most siginificant Jira tasks assigned to you in sprint 1, and state when (or whether) it was completed, and the hours spent.*
* *Example: "Link to Task 2.  It was set and completed in sprint 2.  It took 1 hour.  Extra relevant comment."*
* *To save time, just describe the main (e.g. no more than 3) Jira issues assigned to you in this sprint. You are free to pick which 3 to describe.*
* *Describe any relevant java coding completed by you in Sprint 1.  Also include permalinks to your gitlab commits.*
* *Include the university week number in the subheading, as above.*

### Sprint 2 (University Week 4):

*Do the same for each fully completed sprint.*
