* *Example: "Link to Task 2.  It was set and completed in sprint 2.  It took 1 hour.  Extra relevant comment."*
* *To save time, just describe the main (e.g. no more than 3) Jira issues assigned to you in this sprint. You are free to pick which 3 to describe.*
* *Describe any relevant java coding completed by you in Sprint 1.  Also include permalinks to your gitlab commits.*
