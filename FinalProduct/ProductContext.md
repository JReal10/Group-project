# Product Context

The NHS, and possibly other health organisations in the future, are the target market for forecasting tools for COVID-19, as they are now trying to find solutions to combat the pandemic and reduce the death rates in the United Kingdom. This makes our forecasting tool beneficial to our client (NHS), because it will not only help the NHS make appropriate preparations and ensure that the healthcare system can cope with the demand, but it will also assist the government in implementing regulations.

 ## Legal and Ethical

The data that has been used for this project was imported directly from the official GOV.UK website which exhibits the coronavirus cases statistics. The website was created for the public use, therefore we can legally and rightfully copy, publish, distribute and adapt the shared information by implementing it in our product, therefore, referencing this website should not cause any legal issues. 
The third party libraries we have used for our data are from PDFBox, JFree Chart and JUnit Eclipse, which are all legally available for our team’s use. PDFBox is an open source pure-Java library that can be used to create, alter, extract text and meta-data of PDF files. JFree Chart is available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), which is a licensed software published by the Free Software Foundation, allowing developers and other users to use this library. JUnit Eclipse is also an open and free source software license, under the terms of the Eclipse Public License(EPL), which makes is accessible for us to use. Having to use these libraries arises the question ethically whether we should be charged or not since most of our code is relying on the plugins we have used. The consequences of not relying on external sources 

Ethics, defined by Investopedia, is “A guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity.” There could be potential system failures in the product, which may cause technical difficulties like making it unable to access the information. This could lead to a lack of understanding the gravity of the virus and having inefficient support. 

In addition, if the data got in the wrong hands, it could be used maliciously against the UK. They could potentially try and enable medical resources that is needed for the country to try and improve the covid cases.
