##Economics
[x] What is the total size of your market?
[x] Worldwide human population with access to technology and internet – 4.9 billion
[x] What percent share of the market will you have?
[x] Conservatively a 0.1%/year share of the market would yield 4.9billion/100 = 4.9million potential customers annually after 10 years of operating.
[x] What is the current demand in target market? 
[x] The market demand was very high initially as a large proportion of the world was isolating due to government guidelines owing to Covid-19. Presently, the restrictions have been relaxed by the government and the media is concentrating on other current affairs such as the Russia-Ukraine war. This decrease in influence means that users will not be utilising the app as much as trends suggest. 
[x] What are the trends in target market?
[x] Data suggests that strong growth is seen and continues to be anticipated in the foreseeable future.

##Competition
[x] Which other products are on the market, and what advantages can you offer over them?
[x] As of 2018, the world mobile health app market was valued at just over $28billion with a staggering growth figure of nearly 30%/year. A value of over $100billion is expected by 2023. Mobile health apps or mhealth are designed using complex data analytics. Our software has the advantage that it will compile information that already exists on the internet and present to the customer in a straightforward and user-friendly GUI. The product can also predict the future rates of Covid-19 and this graph can be exported to PDF by businesses to use in presentations. The raw data can also be viewed in a tabular form for statistical purposes. Live data of cases and deaths can be dynamically uploaded at the push of  a button so that up-to-date results can be viewed. The regression/prediction and piecewise regression lines can be used to display the rates of increase and decrease more clearly. Our main issue is making the market aware of the product, to which some advertising cost will be incurred. It has been seen that popular products tend to increase sales sometimes exponentially if market ‘desire’ so ensues e.g., Games such as King Candy Crush were shared/tweeted on social media because it was easy to use, competitive and held the user’s attention, especially at times of boredom or stress. e.g., train or bus journey in conclusion, the more deeply psychologically impactful an app is, the more likely is its success.

[x] The below link shows a prediction of the general trend for health apps by market size for the years 2022-2030. Valued at $38.2 billion in 2021, the expectation of growth of the health app market is nearly 12% year on year. The use of smart phones and tablets is a major contributor to the spread of this information. In yet another article (IQVIA) as of 2021, the medical device network believes there are more than 350,000 digital health apps in global stores. Considering the above, the population is clearly looking to improve overall health. This number of which social media users contribute over 4.5billion people, is nearly 58% of the population of the world! As of 2020, a 65% growth in health application downloads occurred according to the journal ‘Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics’. This again has been attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, where self-management of symptoms has been promoted. Concerning medical approval bodies such as the FDA in America, despite the general public’s appetite for mobile health apps, only 219 were approved by 2018 owing to problems with sensitive information being at risk of hacking and data breaches, such were the number of malicious programs on the internet. Our product is so designed as NOT to require any sensitive data from the user and so GDPR is not an issue.

##Product, Price, Promotion, Place
[x] Describe how the 4Ps apply to your product - Product, Place, Promotion, Price, and what you can do/have done to enhance these aspects. Hint: State the likely price your team would choose.
Research some web-based advertising methods your team could try, and list costs. 
[x] The product has buttons that are user-friendly. It has distinct colours and can be altered dynamically to display the most up-to-date data which can be exported to a PDF format. The app can be sold with or without in-app advertising to generate more revenue. Apps can often be downloaded from mobile app stores for free because revenue is made when the user watches adverts. New revisions of the app can also be sold to businesses who require extra added features. The buttons can be translated to different languages to make it more marketable in other countries. Businesses can be sold a licence if they require many copies or a technical support service. Sentiment analysis can also be used to monitor target words on social media to help when advertising the product. The app could be uploaded to Google Play android store, Apple App Store or Microsoft Store for PCs. The app can be advertised by hiring stalls at Medical Conferences and Expos. The app could also be advertised using mobile marketing consultants such as the one shown below. Their app marketer pro facility charges between $249 and $649 a month as standard. We could use an App Store Optimisation tool (ASO) to increase the interest of the potential buyer.

[x] When estimating the cost of the app, the cost per hour, overhead figure and utilisation factor (holiday, illness and training) should be considered. Also, ‘price to win’ estimates for tender for a contract should be considered where the cost and time expectation of the sponsor is accepted without validation, where a combination of the lowest bidder with the best-established reputation is the required outcome. The product can be adapted to the requirements of each business and business licences can be sold according to a projected quote value and whether a multi-user or multi-platform licence is needed.
##Sales Forecast
[x] How many downloads / sales / shipped units could you realistically achieve in the first 12 months?
[x] How much cash would that bring in?
[x] As it is a new business, it is not expected that the company will make a profit within the first 12 months. Our company will aim to generate £100kpa gross in sales for year 1 based upon 6 people working remotely with no overheads and each person working on the product for 1 day a week (according to Jira Story Points) for 6 months. 
Effort Estimation can be calculated as follows: -
[x] Based on a developer with 3 to 5 years work experience earning £20/hour:
[x] £20 x 8hours x 6 people x 24 weeks = £23,040
[x] $649 = approx. £485
[x] £485 x (6 months + 12 future months marketing) = £8,730
[x] £23,040 + £8,730 = £31,770 cost on year
[x] The average company makes 33% profit per year.
[x] £31,770 + 33% = £42,254.10
[x] This value does not consider any payments to shareholders or any loans that may be taken out to start the business. 
[x] Given the minimum price of a business licence is £200:
[x] £42,254/£200 = 211.27 
[x] So, at least 212 licences should be sold in the first 12 months to make a profit.
[x] The estimate is not based upon use of any bridging loans that may be needed for company seed.
[x] The cost will depend on the requirements of the customer as this will impact the time taken to produce the product and the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). A utilisation factor of 50% also affects the number of staff that are needed for each project.
[x] If each user who has downloaded the mobile app views the product once every day and watches one advert, approximately £1 ($1-$2) will be earned per view which is £365 per app per year per download. If there are 10,000 viewings, this will create a revenue of approx. £36,500 in the first 12 months.
[x] [Link to costing for advert views] (https://www.quora.com/How-much-money-does-an-app-developer-make-from-ads-per-hit)
[x] £42,254 - £36,500 = £5,754
[x] £5,754/200 =28.77
[x] So, we would need to sell 29 licences in the first 12 months to break even and any additional licences sold, or viewings would make profit.
