# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

All of the team has consistently turned up to the Thursday labs and actively participated In the discussions held. Tasks were assigned evenly to all members of the team and assigned according to the different strengths of the team members. Due to the vague project requirements initially presented, the first few sprints were less focused and geared more towards research into the requirements rather than programming the product itself until the requirements shown on moodle became more accurate.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

4 sprints were made overall, 2 of which were 2 week ones due to the large time commitment required to complete the tasks. On sprint 4 there was a scope change to assign the tasks of writing the last 2 reports for the MVP documentation. An issue that the burndown charts present is that tasks were given inaccurate numbers of story points to the amount of effort it takes to complete the task and in future more care over story point allocation should be taken
